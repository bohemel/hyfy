hyfy is (or hopefully will be) a collaborative spotify client controlled via a web interfce.

This is (as most things are) for my own amusement and a reason for me to play around with C (i mainly work with
web programming in PHP/JavaScript). So don't take it too seriously. But feel free to msg me on github or just
take the code and do something cool with it!

I use spank by noname for building hyfy check it out at http://hultinedutainment.se/~noname/?section=spank
