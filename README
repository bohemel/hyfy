hyfy is (or hopefully will be) a collaborative spotify client controlled via a web interfce.

This is as most things are for my own amusement and for me to play around with C (i mainly work with
web programming in PHP/JavaScript).

I use spank by noname for building hyfy check it out at http://hultinedutainment.se/~noname/?section=spank
